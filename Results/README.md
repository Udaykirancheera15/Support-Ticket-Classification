# Results - Limited Dataset

## Incomplete Results Due to File Size

Please note that due to the large size of the result files, only a subset of the results has been included in this repository. Specifically, only **3 result files** have been pushed to GitHub for accessibility purposes.

### Files Included
The following result files have been included:
- **Results/Model.ioo**
- **Results/Performance.ioo**
- **Results/WordList.ioo**

These files contain key insights and performance metrics related to the ticket classification models and topic modeling. However, the full set of results, which includes additional performance metrics, predictions, and detailed analysis, could not be pushed due to file size limitations.

## Reasons for Limited File Push
1. **Large File Sizes**: The full results dataset is large and exceeds GitHubâ€™s file size limits for repositories.
2. **Performance Considerations**: Pushing the entire set of results would significantly slow down operations and make the repository harder to manage.

## Alternative Ways to Access Full Results
If you require the full set of results, please consider the following options:
1. **Direct Request**: Open an issue in this repository, and we can arrange to provide the full results via alternative methods (e.g., cloud storage links).
2. **Generate Results Locally**: You can re-run the project workflows locally or on a RapidMiner AI Hub instance to generate the full set of results using the provided processes.

## Conclusion
We appreciate your understanding regarding the limitations of this repository. The 3 included result files should provide valuable insights for testing and validation, and we are happy to assist in providing additional results if needed.
